# Terminal
Created a terminal, in which was implemented with Python programming language.

## About Project 
Create a simulation of a kernel or terminal form Mac OS/Linux. The project involves python programming language in which can have standard input and command line version, to simulate a real kernel and its functionalities. This was oriented to the Operating Systems creation, which I am really interested into. This project was a success, but still can make it better with some tweaks.

## Instructions
Run the command `python project/pylang/pyprompt.py` inside the main repository folder.
Enjoy your new terminal.
